WEEK 1 ASSESSMENT

Project Title

**Apple Stock Data Analysis using Python**
 Description

This project performs a basic analysis of **Apple (AAPL) stock data** using Python.

The dataset is stored in an Excel file named `AAPL.xlsx`.

The project is performed using **Google Colab** and Python libraries.

Technologies Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Excel Dataset

 Dataset

The dataset contains Apple stock information with the following columns:

* **Date** – Stock date
* **Open** – Opening stock price
* **High** – Highest stock price
* **Low** – Lowest stock price
* **Close** – Closing stock price
* **Adj Close** – Adjusted closing price
* **Volume** – Number of shares traded

 Steps Performed

1. Import Libraries

The required Python libraries are imported:

* Pandas for data handling
* NumPy for numerical operations
* Matplotlib for visualization

2. Upload Dataset

The `AAPL.xlsx` file is uploaded into Google Colab using the file upload option.

3. Read Dataset

The Excel file is loaded using Pandas:

```python
df = pd.read_excel("AAPL.xlsx")
```

 4. Display First 5 Rows

The first five records are displayed using:

```python
df.head()
```

This helps us understand the beginning of the dataset.

 5. Display Last 5 Rows

The last five records are displayed using:

```python
df.tail()
```

This helps us understand the end of the dataset.

 Dataset Information

The dataset contains stock market information such as:

| Column    | Description            |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Date      | Stock trading date     |
| Open      | Opening price          |
| High      | Highest price          |
| Low       | Lowest price           |
| Close     | Closing price          |
| Adj Close | Adjusted closing price |
| Volume    | Trading volume         |

 Objective

The main objective of this assessment is to:

* Load an Excel dataset
* Understand the dataset
* Display the data
* Perform basic data analysis using Python
* Learn Pandas and NumPy basics
* Prepare the data for further analysis and visualization

How to Run

1. Open **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the `.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells one by one.
4. When asked, upload `AAPL.xlsx`.
5. Execute all the cells to see the results.
